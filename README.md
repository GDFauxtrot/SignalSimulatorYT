# SignalSimulatorYT
A Signal Simulator mod that adds YouTube support to the in-game VHS.

SignalSimulatorYT is a first attempt at modifying the Unity game "Signal Simulator". It adds support for watching YouTube embedded videos in the in-game VHS screen.

Made with a collection of tools:

  * HarmonyX v2.10.0
  * ZenFulcrum Embedded Browser (Unity store asset, license acquired)
  * Visual Studio 2017
  * A lot of time after work and hair pulled from YouTube embedding

I do not plan on updating this often! There will be some fixes here and there, but for the most part I want to focus on other modding efforts around Signal Simulator. I also do not expect there to be many updates for Signal Simulator in general, so if something updates and breaks this mod, I may come back to provide a fix.

## Download

Check the sidebar on the right for releases! Be sure to follow the instructions included carefully.

## How to modify

Included with each release is a compiled binary for the Windows version of ZFBrowser 3.0.0, which is required in order to build any changes. It is the exact same version included with the Windows demo. However, If you do wish to make your own changes, make sure to follow the steps below.

(A license was purchased from the Unity asset store in order to use the Embedded Browser for this mod. You do not need one if you wish to make your own changes, but it is highly recommended! It's also a great asset to have in general.)
